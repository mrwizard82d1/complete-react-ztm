We cover topics in both react **and** Javascript

Array methods:
- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `reduce()`
- `find()`
- `includes()`

Can **run** JavaScript code in the **application console**
- For example, this code maps
	- An array of integers from 1 to 4, inclusive
	- To an array of integers from 2 to 5, inclusive
```js
		const myArray = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];<br>
		myArray.map(el => el + 1); 
```
