- Goals
	- Apply styles
	- Better understand how to use styles is JavaScript
- `App.js` is a singleton
	- Include `App.css`
	- This file defines styling for **entire** application
- React will
	- Combine **all** referenced `.css` files in all modules into a **single** `.css` file used by application
	- Consequently, **all** `.css` defined in **all** files used by the single HTML page rendered by browser
- Consequently,
	- Each component should define the `css` styling that is pertinent **to that component**
- Remember
	- All style files within components are
		- **Combined into a single .css file**
		- Delivered to the browser
	- As a result,
		- Any style defined "for" a component
		- Actually may apply to **any** component
- We `import` `.css` styles in specific React components
	- To communicate to other developers
- Will learn how to use styles in JSX in a later module
	- This technique does not have this same "gotcha"
