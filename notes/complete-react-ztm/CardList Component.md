- Goal
	- Refactor the "card list section" of `App`
	- Into a reusable React component
- Naming
	- Our choice `card-list.component.jsx`
	- Other options
		- `index.jsx` 
		- `card-list.jsx`
			- Possible problems
				- Other files may exist in the folder
- Components **must** return a single HTML element
	- But may contain other HTML elements as children
	- Rendered HTML **cannot** return **multiple**  sibling HTML elements
		- Ways around this limitation
		- But good rule of thumb
- We will move our original, commented out code into our component
	- Using `props`
