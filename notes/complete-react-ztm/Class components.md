Key concept: **Rendering**
- Great developers understand
	- When react is
		- Rendering and
		- Re-rendering components

Review project
- Execute `yarn run` **renders** the page
	- Rendering completes when user can interact with page

Separation of component code
- React components tell `react` **what to render**
	- JSX makes that much easier by
		- Transpiling what looks like  `.html` code into **Javascript**

Both functional and class components are rendered to .html and Javascript

To illustrate the use of a class, we will **transform** the 
	- Functional `App` components
	- Into a **class** component
