- Goal: 
	- Move actual monsters data into component
- `Input` component **already** have "props"
- Can name and pass whatever we want as a prop
- Question
	- Do we pass in 
		- The filtered list or
		- The original list?
- Separate responsibilities
	- The search box does filtering
	- Consequently, `CardList` **only** displays
		- Whatever it is given
- To perform some "diagnostics", we print the text "render" at each call to `CardList.render()`
	- Render prints **multiple times**
		- Twice in video
		- 3x in my experiments
	- Why?
		- First call to `render()`
			- First time through code. `props` is empty array.
		- Second call is "repeated"
			- My hypothesis:
				- The `App` state consists of 
					- `monsters`
					- `textToMatch`
				- The first render occurs when `monsters` is initialized
				- The second render occurs when the initial "empty filter" of the search box is processed
				- But I'm not really certain
