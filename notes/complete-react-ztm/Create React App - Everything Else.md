Will be looking at `App.js`

`App.js` **represents** entire application
- Two imports
	- Logo
	- `./App.css` (CSS for application)

`App.js` is a component
- Returns a representation of `.html` page with `.css`

Function `App`
- Returns a function (returning `.html` code)
- Highlights the purpose of React
	- Every React function returns `.html`

One caveat
- Many videos were created with an **older** version of `create-react-app`
	- Consequently, some pages shown on pages may **differ** from what I see with my own code
