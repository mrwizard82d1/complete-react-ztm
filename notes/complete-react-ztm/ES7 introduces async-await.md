- An exciting feature
	- Transforms async operations to **synchronous**
- By using the `async` keyword to declare a function
	- We can now use `await` within the function
- Allows us to write code that **looks like**
	- Synchronous code
	- But is actually **asynchronous**
- H2 handle errors asynchronously
	- In synchronous code, we use `catch`
	- In asynchronous code, we use a `try-catch` block
	- Note that it may take "some time" to actually log the error
