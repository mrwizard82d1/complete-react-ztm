Many competing libraries have appropriated the "React concepts"

Introduced react "key words"
- Declarative
- JSX
- Components
- State
- Props
- Virtual DOM

The basics of react
- Describe a UI in a **declarative** way
- Using **JSX** 
- To specify **components**
- Separating the UI description from the **state** it manipulates
- Let react move changes from the **virtual DOM** to the actual DOM

The job of a React developer
1. Decide on components of the UI
2. Decide the state and **where** it lives (which components)
3. What changes should we make when the **state changes**
