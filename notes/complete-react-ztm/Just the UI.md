Previous UI libraries were "opinionated"
	- For example, `AngularJS` was an entire kitchen
		- And you had to use **their kitchen**

By contrast, `react` is a stove; the remaining tools are up to you.

Allows "React Everywhere"
- React Native
- React 360 (a virtual reality app)
- React Desktop (`electron` etc.)
- react-blessed (works with terminal and command prompt)

All react applications use
	- The core react library
	- A technology-specific react library
