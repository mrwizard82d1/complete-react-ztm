`App` component renders **entire** application

Change contents of `App` component to render one or more monsters
	- Generally, all of a react application are contained in the `App` component and its children

Using `Array.map()`
- Expects a function to be executed on each element
- Our code generates a sequence of `<h1>...</h1>` elements
	- The child of each `h1` tag is the name of the monster
