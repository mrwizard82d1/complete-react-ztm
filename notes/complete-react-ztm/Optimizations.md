- The Javascript function responding to `onChange` 
	- Is **anonymous**
	- Consequently, it is **recreated** repeatedly
	- As a result, every time through the `render()` method
		- Recreates the function
		- Slows down ever so slightly
		- Remember than React calls `render` **every change of the application state**
		- This behavior is **incorrect** because body of function **never changes**
	- "Repair error" by moving code to specifically named function
- We currently repeatedly reference members of `this`
	- Because we are using ES6, we can actually use destructuring to avoid this repetition
	- We can destructure both
		- `this.state`
		- `this` itself
- Main benefits
		- Destructuring makes code more readable
		- Extract method improves run-time performance
