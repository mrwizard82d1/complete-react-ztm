- We must filter down our `monsters` list to the **filtered** list of monsters
	- Filter monsters by
		- Invoking `Array.filter()`
		- If function supplied to `filter`
			- Returns `true`, keep item
			- Returns `false`, do not include item in result
- Simply calling `String.include()` generally works
	- Problem with capitalization
- General best practice
	- **Use non-modifying functions**
	- Specifically, treat **all** items in `this.state` as **immutable**
- Issue
	- Typing `lea` filters "Leanne" **out**
	- `String.includes()` is **case-sensitive**
- After fix,
	- Program now works if one types
		- "lea"
		- And "Lea"
- However, still have an issue:
	- Once we filter the list, it is **permanently** filtered
	- That is, we "lose" the original list of monsters
