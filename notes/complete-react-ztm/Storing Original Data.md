- Monsters, we have a problem
	- Entering text in the search box
	- **Changes** the list of monsters
		- That is, the state of our application
- We want to change our implementation
	- We will need to
		- **Not** change `this.state.monsters`
	- Two options:
		- Move filtering code outside of `return` **but still in `render()`**
		- Move filtering code into new function
- Easiest change: move filter code into `render` but
	- **Outside** the JSX HTML code
	- This change also requires 
		- Adding `textToMatch` to `this.state`
		- Change the code that renders the list to start with `filteredMonsters`,  a local variable
