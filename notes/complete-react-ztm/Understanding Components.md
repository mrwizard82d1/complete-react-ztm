- Goals
	- Understanding components conceptually
	- Deep(er) dive
- What is a component?
	- `App` is a (class) component
	- Governs a piece of the UI
		- Entire applications currently lives in a single component
- Remember, `react` ties together
	- The appearance of the application
		- That is, the UI
	- The functionality of the application
		- The "code-behind"
- Our definition: a component
	- Ties together the appearance and functionality of the UI
		- The code itself
	- Also aims to tie together portions of the code into a reusable chunk of code
		- Currently, our application ties together
			- A search bar
			- The list of matching monsters
	- We can **generalize** the two "components" of our UI
- Goal of components
	- Create "Lego blocks"
		- Requires **single responsibility** for components
- Current state of `App`
	- Search bar and list are tied together
	- Contains **all** our code
- To create actual components, we must **generalize** our two features
	- A search box
	- A list of results
- Begin by extracting our list of monsters into a general component
- Components reflected in directory structure
	- Many React applications create a `components` subdirectory of `src`
	- Since we have identified two components, we create two subdirectories of `components`
		- `card-list`
		- `search-box`
